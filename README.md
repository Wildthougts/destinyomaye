## Summary

This is a simple web app that uses TailwindCSS & Framer Motion to create a nice looking UI. It also uses Next.js to create a serverless function that sends an email to me when they submit the contact form. Feel free to use this as a template for your own projects. I will be adding more features to this when I get some free time. Remember to leave a star :)

## Getting Started

First, Create a google account app password from https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

Then, create a `.env.local` file similar to `.env.example` and add your app password and email address.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
